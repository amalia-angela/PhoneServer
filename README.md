# PhpServer

This is a php server, that receive and send messages between phone devices. The messages are stored into a phpMyAdmin database. This program is the server for the [PhoneApp](https://github.com/amalia-angela/PhoneApp) application.


## Installation
You need a code editor and xampp.
### Code editor
I used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), but feel free to use any other code editor you are familiar with. If you choose to use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) go the official page, download the installer and follow the setup steps.

### XAMPP
Go the official [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) page, download the installer and follow the setup steps.
